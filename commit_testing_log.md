## Testing Results

### Current Status (22f3c1d) - ‚ùå BROKEN
- **Issue**: Window switching not working for any apps (Slack, Chrome, etc.)
- **Symptoms**: AX API calls report success but windows don't actually come to front
- **Output**: All operations show success but no visual window switching occurs

### Going back 3 commits to: ebfa0af - "Add dock icon and proper quit functionality"
- **Date**: Testing now...
- **Status**: TBD
- **Notes**: This was before MRU ordering implementation

---

## Notes
- The issue seems to be that MRU ordering or subsequent changes broke the actual window activation
- AX API calls succeed but don't have visual effect
- Need to find the last working commit and identify what broke it
